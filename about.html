        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi! My name is Guoyang Luan. I am currently pursuing my bachelor degree in computer 
            science in UBC. My background before I came to UBC for the CS degree was economics 
            and finance. I did my previous bachelor degree in Economics and a master degree in 
            Taxation in China and sequentially worked as an analyst in investment banking for 
            two years. It was exactly where I learned to do things “smartly” mostly by taking 
            advantage of data analysis techniques and script programming skills.</p>
        <p>Specifically, I managed to write code to incorporate the raw market data automatically
             into weekly analysis reports so as to improve data analysis efficiency. It was so hard 
             to build those script initially but once you get the hang of it, life became easy and 
             fantastic. Gradually my interest in computer science got deeper and deeper so I decided
              to make a slight shift in my career goal which is to become a developer (ideally more 
              finance-oriented).</p>
        <p>In UBC, I got the change to fully grasp the knowledge of computer science systematically 
            and comprehensively. I engaged in building interesting personal projects as well as 
            participating in “hackathon” with initiative. I am so passionate and happy about 
            what I am doing now. But I know that getting exposure to cutting-edge technologies 
            and finding a position in those amazing tech companies require much more than what 
            I’ve done so far.</p>
